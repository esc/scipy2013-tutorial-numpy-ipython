About the Material
------------------

* **Ipython**

  * An IPython notebook demonstrating the IPython notebook
  * A demo session of the IPython shell

* **Numpy** (3 hours)

  * Two IPython notebooks
  * (Semi-)Automatically converted from `Python Scientific Lecture Notes <http://scipy-lectures.github.io/>`_

  * The generated HTML is included in the GitHub Repository / Zip file and
    available online

How to Follow
-------------

* Grab the IPython notebook, try out the examples, work on the exercises, all
  from within the notebook.

  shell or a Python file.

About IPython
-------------

* De facto Python interpreter with bells and whistles
* Since 2011: available in the browser as *IPython notebook*:

  .. sourcecode:: console

     $ ipython notebook --pylab=inline

.. raw:: latex
